v7: 3-block DenseNet, 4 layers per block, feature maps 48, 32, 16. Trained with lambda = 300000, fine tuned with lambda 350000 and larger rotations from ~N(0, 0.01).
    Trained with uncropped smoothness constraint over entire image (including artificial padding added as augmentation), with MSE cropped to 48 pixels from each side
    of the interior of this padding.

v8: 3-block DenseNet, 4 layers per block, feature maps 32, 32, 16. Trained with lambda = 1000000, trained with *correct* rotations and masking on the black pixels of the
    prediction and target (unaugmented) slices. Random black padding is added around the image (256px). Augmentation included contrast and missing section squares,
    in source, target, or both, up to 3 squares in each.

v9: 3-block DenseNet, 4 layers per block, feature maps 32, 32, 16. Trained with lambda = 1000000. Has trained layers at mip 6, 7, and 8.
